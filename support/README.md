# Support for popular technologies

You can use this Ansible role from other popular technologies:

- [Jenkins](jenkins/): if you want to deploy your APIs on 3scale from a Jenkins pipeline, using a custom slave.
- [Ansible Tower / AWX](awx/): if you want to enforce RBAC, have audit, etc.
- [Docker](docker/): deploy an API to 3scale from the command line with minimal dependencies
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes/): deploy an API to 3scale from a Kubernetes Job
- [OpenShift](openshift/): deploying an API to 3scale is as easy as starting a Build from a BuildConfig
